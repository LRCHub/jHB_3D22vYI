[00:19.33] No one knows how I live my life
[00:23.81] 'Cause I don't belong to anywhere
[00:28.37] No one knows the truth inside me
[00:44.37] 
[00:32.32] Don't know the fever
[00:34.33] That's so deep in me
[00:44.33] 
[00:37.53] Come on give me fever
[00:40.18] I want the shock
[00:43.05] To see how much you kill my mind
[00:46.99] Won't you go for your life
[00:50.24] Fever... Burns on a brand-new-day
[01:06.74] 
[00:56.89] No one knows what's your struggle
[01:00.37] 'Cause you're in the air
[01:05.28] Don't care 'bout your values till U die
[01:09.48] Between reality and dreams,
[01:12.40] There's right
[01:18.90] 
[01:13.73] Wanna give U fever
[01:18.37] I wanna rock U
[01:20.16] Showing how much I get blind
[01:23.66] Ma past can be a lie
[01:26.91] Fever... Burns on a brand-new-day
[01:43.41] 
[01:32.74] Good-bye, fever from yesterday
[01:55.42] That's the real knack you all know
[02:00.47] Welcome to my fever, today
[02:04.71] That will cool down, but never know
[02:22.21] 
[02:10.35] I' ain't got fever
[02:13.58] No one is intoxicated by nature
[02:18.64] Now it's time to learn
[02:22.20] Fever will go down so soon
[02:35.20] 
[02:28.05] Won't you give me fever?
[02:31.66] I want the shock
[02:33.11] To see how much you kill my mind
[02:37.38] Won't go back to where I was
[02:41.47] 'Cause that's the only way to win, oh
