No one knows how I live my life
'Cause I don't belong to anywhere
No one knows the truth inside me
Don't know the fever
that's so deep in me
Come on give me fever
I want the shock
to see how much you kill my mind
Won't you go for your life
Fever… Burns on a brand-new-day
No one knows what's your struggle
'Cause you're in the air
Don't care ‘bout your values till U die
Between reality and dreams,
there's right
Wanna give U fever
I wanna rock U
showing how much I get blind
My past can be a lie
Fever… Burns on a brand-new-day
Good-bye, fever from yesterday
That's the real knack you all know
Welcome to my fever, today
That will cool down, but never know
I ain't got fever
No one is intoxicated by nature
Now it's time to learn
Fever will go down so soon
Won't you give me fever?
I want the shock
to see how much you kill my mind
Won't go back to where I was
'Cause that's the only way to win, oh
